My responsibilities included designing and developing the complete user interface using React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components, creating a modern, responsive, and intuitive admin dashboard and customer-facing storefront. On the backend, I architected and implemented RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, designed the MongoDB database schema with Mongoose for efficient data modeling, and built the entire authentication and authorization system from scratch including JWT token-based security, password encryption with bcrypt, role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Manager, and Staff roles, and secure session management. The platform features comprehensive CRM capabilities including customer profile management, order tracking and history, sales analytics and reporting dashboards, inventory management with real-time stock updates, product catalog with categories and variants, multi-vendor support, payment gateway integration, email notifications and alerts, advanced search and filtering, data export functionality, and automated reporting. Key technical implementations include protected API routes with middleware authentication, file upload handling for product images, pagination and data optimization, error handling and logging, API rate limiting and security measures, and database indexing for performance. The frontend showcases modern UI/UX patterns with dynamic forms with validation, real-time data updates, interactive charts and analytics visualizations, responsive tables with sorting and filtering, modal dialogs and notifications, loading states and skeleton screens, and optimized performance with code splitting and lazy loading. This project demonstrates enterprise-level full-stack development skills including scalable API architecture, complex state management, secure authentication flows, database design and optimization, RESTful API best practices, deployment and DevOps, and building production-ready SaaS applications. Technologies utilized include React.js for dynamic UI, TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, shadcn/ui for accessible component library, Node.js and Express.js for backend API, MongoDB with Mongoose for database, JWT for authentication tokens, and deployment on cloud platforms.',
